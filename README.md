# Portfolio for me (Aleksander Spetalen) 2022

## Description

This is a portfolio for me (Aleksander Spetalen) 2022. It is a project for the course Web portfolio 2 at Noroff. The project is made with React and is hosted on Netlify.

I went for a simple style with a little more information about myself then in portfolio 1. I also added a contact form with a little bit of validation. I also added a little bit of animation to the page.

I am using some fun free API from rapidAPI on this project, so if you want to use it you need to get your own API key.
The two API's I am using is: chuck Norris jokes and openWeatherMap, with Oslo being the default city.
